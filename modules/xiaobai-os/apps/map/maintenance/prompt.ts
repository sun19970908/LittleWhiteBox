Omission from a summary does not establish that a collection is empty.',

These additions need not be mentioned in the latest turn.',
    '- Occurrences: visits, actor movement, actions, destruction, discoveries and task progress require story evidence. Completing the setting never proves an event happened. A lie, guess or plan in dialogue is not proof it came true.',

const TOOLS = [

    '- MapAtlasEdit: establish destinations, positions, routes and world-level actor positions. Parents and endpoints may be created in the same call.',

    '- Keys are stable identities: reuse them when names change and preserve positions and routes. Parent expresses containment, not traversability. Removing a location removes its descendants, routes, actor positions and scene; remove only for explicit correction, disappearance or destruction, never because someone left.',

Related objects may touch; unrelated solid footprints should not overlap. Do not distribute objects evenly just to fill the map.',

A very small footprint is drawn as a plain block; icon detail appears once the object is large enough on screen.',
    '- An icon with only `at` is a point marker, not a sized object.',
    '- A forest is a terrain area with material `forest`; its canopy is generated. A sized `tree` icon is one physical tree.',
    '- Walls draw boundaries only. Openings are the gaps you leave; a door icon does not cut a wall. Nothing is snapped, rerouted or reconnected for you.',
    '- Path points are joined by straight segments. Curve points are positions the line passes through; smoothing is generated.',
    '- Rotation turns a rect or circle clockwise around its centre. At zero, chair and sofa backs and bed pillows are at the north edge, seats face south, and bridges run north-south.',
    '- Labels are positioned automatically and never rotated. Put the name on the element itself; a separate label element is for text that belongs to no object, and the scene title is already shown.',
